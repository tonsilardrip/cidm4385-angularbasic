This is just the first homework that we had to do. We had to do a temp conversion. Data entry for phone numbers and. Accepting login information. 

## Getting Started
These are the projects that are on my Cloud9

* [Cloud9 temphtml](https://cidm4385-angularbasic-tonsilardrip.c9users.io/temp.html) - AngularJS app that converts temperature units to and from Fahrenheit to Celcius (and reverse)
* [Cloud9 html2](https://cidm4385-angularbasic-tonsilardrip.c9users.io/index2.html#) - Modified "Index2.html"

* [Cloud9 tempConvert](https://cidm4385-angularbasic-tonsilardrip.c9users.io/tempConvert.html) - Another temp converter just for fun.
